This app is designed for the Oasis Championship, a PGA Tour Champions event taking place in Boca Raton, FL every February.

Leading up to the tournament, a large amount of tickets are printed and delivered to the sponsors. The tournament office needs to track and record each ticket that gets sent out. Before my app, everything being recorded is handwritten, time conuming, and disorginized. With this app, it is now clean, searchable and orginized and saves us a lot of time not re-writing the company name for each ticket we send them.
